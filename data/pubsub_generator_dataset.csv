- we would be happy to process an exchange for you in the form of a physical gift card + turkish towel so you can gift her that, and she can purchase the suit in january!

- we could process the exchange for the suit in lava & dragonfruit, in either size 6 or 8 so she can give it a try, and if she would rather the sangria & dragonfruit, we would be happy to process that exchange for her in january!

here is a label for you to return the suit you received. we are excited to help you with this thoughtful gift for your daughter and are sincerely appreciative of your patience and understanding! please let us know if there is anything else we can help with!

i just took a look at your order #11988, and am happy to share that i do see that you received the 20% off of the following that you purchased:

*(1) watermelon hair & body butter

the original price of the above product is is: $35

you received 20% off of the above item and paid: $28

please know that the 20% was only for the watermelon hair & body butter and not your entire purchase. and i apologize for any miscommunication regarding your savings and it is my hope that i am able to get you the best deal available :) 

what is next?

please know that our computer system was not able to automatically identify and compute that the (4) products in your cart, were the items that composed our special priced bundle.

however, i am more than happy to honor the price of the bundle below, for your order #11988:

*(1) bundle - watermelon fragrance with organic hemp seed oil for hair growth (4 items) cost-$82.00

i am also more than happy to apply your ""quiz"" 20% off discount code to the $82 price, and provide you with a refund in the amountÂ which reflects a 20% discount on your order.

on behalf of the company, i sincerely apologize to you for the delay in delivery of your order with us. we have suffered through mechanical and equipment failures, delayed vendor shipments, and delays while moving to our new facility during this extremely busy holiday season. however, i realize that an excuse is not a substitute for good service. i look forward to making this right for you as soon as possible. we are trying our best to minimize the delay as much as we can, and get everything rectified to the best of our ability. we have equipped our departments with more staff, who are currently working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day to ensure that these christmas orders are fulfilled and shipped out as soon as they can be.

i have been promised by our production head that all pre-december 5th orders will be finished and shipped by the end of january. you should receive a shipping confirmation email within the next 17 days!

you have been a supportive customer, and we are grateful to you for giving our company and product a chance. i am so saddened that this is how the situation turned out, and i understand the frustration of not having your order to you on time. however, in the end, i would really love for you to still receive your order and be able to enjoy our pieces for years to come.

i have three options for you that iâm happy to offer:  

1. i can offer you a redline steel e-gift card in the amount of $50.00 to put towards any future order with us, or to give as a gift to another friend or loved one while keeping your order processing.
2. i can refund you that $50.00 and also still keep the order active. 
3. i can cancel your order and refund your purchase. 
 
at your earliest convenience, please let me know how you would most prefer me to proceed. thank you.

thank you sincerely for your email and i more than happy to assist you  :)  

i am glad to share that we applied to your original email inquiry, just about an hour ago.  please see below for original email:

*******************

hi sonola,

thank you sincerely for your email and i am more than happy to assist you :)  please allow me address your inquiry below:

1).  please note that our pure flaxseed gel was created to enhance the natural curl pattern. a good rule of thumb is, whatever your hair looks like now when it is wet, is the curl pattern that our pure flaxseed gel will enhance.  therefore, being that your hair was relaxed just 3 weeks ago, i would not suggest our pure flaxseed gels, because it will not curl your relaxed hair.

2). our products can be used on both natural and relaxed hair, such as our hair & body butters. yet please know, that if you have concerns regarding our products and any potential reaction that can take place with any hair treatments, i would like to recommend that you please consult with a licensed hairstylist. 

on our curlmix.com website, we provided a list of ingredients for each of our curlmix products. and at the time of this email, you can find the list of ingredients for each of our curlmix products, under the ""description"" tab currently located below the ""add to cart"" button.Â 

scroll down all the way toward the bottom of the page, and you will find the ingredient list to the curlmix product page you are on. and to ensure you see all of the ingredients, please make sure you scroll down the entire page, until you have reached the end of the page you are on.

also, i would like to share our following note regarding allergens just in case:

""allergens:
ingredients may have been derived from corn, soy, wheat, and/or nut products. they may have also been produced in a facility that makes those products.Â 

we recommend conducting a ""patch test"" on your arm and a section of hair before use.""


3). yes, our curlmix products are safe to use on color treated hair.  and if ever in doubt, please always feel free to do a patch test on your hair.  

4). if you have any concerns about using our curlmix products on your beautiful treated hair.  please consult with a licensed hairstylist. 

5). you expressed that your hair was relaxed 3 weeks ago, and you now plan to get a platinum hair color soon.  please consult with a licensed hairstylist regarding the potential breakage/damage that can be potentially caused when getting a platinum hair color on relaxed hair.

6). our founders are kim & tim lewis

co- founder kim lewis,  earned a bachelorâs degree in logistics & marketing from the university of illinois.

co- founder tim attended the university of illinois at urbana-champaign double majoring in economics & psychology.

take care sonola and thank you for your interest in curlmix :)

best,

the diy cutting sheets is indeed smaller. it runs through a different press and is more efficient for us in that we print these items by the batchload. the minimum quantity allows for us to maintain this efficiency. we recently lowered this minimum quantity as it used to 25 sheets and is now only 5, to better suit our clients' needs.

the poster is a larger sheet, prints only on the 120# mohawk superfine eggshell ultrawhite, using a different press and only has a quantity of 1. as wholesale printers, this single quantity availability and premium stock is reflected in this price.

thank you,

i hope you are having a wonderful day. i am truly sorry for the extended delays.  ð we estimate approximately 9 - 21 days  delivery for customers within united states, europe, oceana and south-east asia. for countries outside these regions, we estimate 14 - 35 days. 

occasionally we experience unavoidable hold-ups with customs in certain countries, which can slow down delivery speeds. we do our best to mark packages correctly so that this happens as little as possible!

you can track your items at this link: {{ tracking url }}

if you have any questions or need any help, donât hesitate to get back in touch!


i hope that helps! please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. i would be more than happy to assist you. have a fantastic week ahead. ð

all the best,

thanks for your reply.

i have not noticed the hard reset causing additional problems. i always suggest also doing the firmware update as well and then allowing the sphero to charge fully before attempting to connect again. if you have done both of those and continue to experience problems with the one sphero, let me know, and we will see what replacements options we have.

if you have any further questions please let me know.

thanks for reaching out to us and for your order. the way this type of shipping service works is that the package is picked up from us with other international shipments and transported to fedex is main export facility in new jersey. the transfer of the packages from us to the nj location is tracked under a different tracking number from your individual tracking. once the package arrives in nj, it is scanned again and then sent off to the particular international country, in this case spain. i can see that this happened on feb 5th. this means that the package is now on the way to spain. as soon as it touches down there will be another update on the tracking. at that point, it is then turned over to the local post for final delivery.

as you can see, it is a bit of different shipping service than normal, but it does allow us to offer free shipping for our international customers, excluding duties of course. the caveat is that it can take up to 21 business days for delivery.

the good news is that the first update seems to have been registered as of feb 5th, so you can see the item is definitely on the way.

please let me know if you had any questions or concerns.

thanks,
riaz

31457873,4517,"good afternoon amanda and michael, 

thank you for getting in touch and the additional images. first of all, i do sincerely apologise for the inconvenience you had. 

please note that i can only find a note on your order that you have requested room of choice service for your delivery (which was performed, according to our records). assembly service needs to be booked separately and comes with an extra fee of $50. please refer to our shipping & delivery page for more information about the room of choice service. 

i am sorry that the gas mechanism on the right-hand side got bent when you were trying to push it down. i have already requested a replacement of the whole mechanism for you and our distribution centre team will dispatch this to you as soon as possible. the delivery coordinator will contact you once they have the parts good to go in order to book in the delivery. 

in the meantime, you can detach the gas mechanism with basic tools and at least use the bed to sleep on. it is only the gas lift function that you can not use for a few days. i do apologise for this inconvenience. 

regarding the crooked seam, could you kindly send me a photo of the fabric, so i can look into this further for you? 

again - i am very sorry about the inconvenience and i will do my very best to get this resolved for you at the earliest. 

warmest regards, 

sandrine // customer experience team

there was no reason to dump out the product as its 100% safe to consume. the sliver that fell into the bottle is from the seal not anything else. the inner seal is compressed so from air pressure it may open. however as you indicated the outside seal was fully on the bottle so its 100% safe to consume. it is only a problem if both the outside and inside seal are opened. we always inspect all bottles for the outside seal before they ship so its unlikely you would ever get a product with an open outside seal. the inside seal cannot be inspected without removing the outside seal.

thanks for following up! we do have a few suggestions that may help to improve your experience. 

-were you able to remove the original factory insoles from the shoes before replacing with our insoles? often, customers will find that their shoes are too tight because they have placed the protalus on top of the existing insole.

-our insoles are designed to be trimmed if needed in order to ensure a perfect fit. if they are simply too long for your shoes, we suggest trimming the toe down to size. you can use the factory insoles from the shoes as a trimming guide to get the right shape and length! trimming the insoles does not void our money back guarantee. 

furthermore, if you feel like the m100 is too thick for your shoes, or offer too much arch support, then our t100 may be a better fit for you. the t series is designed for more low profile shoes and has a more moderate arch support. if you are interested in trying this style, we would be happy to assist you with an exchange completely free of charge. 

for further assistance, please let us know if this is how you would like to proceed. we look forward to serving you!
